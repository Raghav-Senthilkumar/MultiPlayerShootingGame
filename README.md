Photon Multiplayer Tank Game

Overview

  This project is a multiplayer tank battle game built using Photon. The game allows players to connect to an online lobby, where they can set their usernames and join or create multiplayer matches. Once two players are matched, they are placed into an interactive battlefield where each player controls a tank. The tanks can move around the environment, aiming to strategically position themselves while avoiding enemy fire.

  Each player can fire cube-shaped bullets at their opponent, and the objective is to land a hit while dodging incoming attacks. The game ends as soon as one of the players is hit, declaring the other player as the winner. Photon handles real-time synchronization between players, ensuring smooth gameplay and interaction between networked users. The waiting room system ensures that players can join an active session seamlessly, and game mechanics like shooting, movement, and hit detection are handled through Unity and Photon.
